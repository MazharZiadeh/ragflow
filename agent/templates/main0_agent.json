Includes what/when/who/where/how-to/what-should questions. If in doubt between Conversational and Simple_Lookup, choose Simple_Lookup.\n\n------\nCategory: Conversational\nDescription: ONLY greetings, casual chat, thank yous, or meta-questions about the assistant itself. Examples: Hello, How are you, Thanks, What can you do? Do NOT classify factual or procedural questions here.\n\n------\nCategory: Complex_Analysis\nDescription: Complex queries requiring analysis, comparison, or synthesis across multiple sources. Includes 'How' or 'Why' questions, summaries, comparisons. Triggers comprehensive retrieval.\n\n---- Instructions ----\n - Consider both explicit mentions and implied context\n - Prioritize the most specific applicable category\n - Return only the category name without explanations\n - Use \"Other\" only when no other category fits\n\n \n---- Examples ----\nUSER: \"What is machine learning?\" → Simple_Lookup\nUSER: \"What should I do in case of a fire?\" → Simple_Lookup\nUSER: \"How do I handle chemicals safely?\" → Simple_Lookup\nUSER: \"Who is responsible for lab safety?\" → Simple_Lookup\nUSER: \"Hi there\" → Conversational\nUSER: \"Thank you\" → Conversational\nUSER: \"What can you do?\" → Conversational\nUSER: \"Compare supervised and unsupervised learning\" → Complex_Analysis\nUSER: \"Why did the Roman Empire fall?\" → Complex_Analysis\n",

Moreover, it is the vision of KAUST to be a leader among its peers in the international research community for its health, safety, and environmental performance.\n\nKAUST's commitment to health, safety, and environmental performance extends to all functions within the University. However, because of the special safety concerns that arise in a laboratory setting, this Laboratory Safety Manual has been developed by the Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) Department to serve as a general guide to laboratory safety within KAUST. It is to be used as a resource to assist laboratories in designing their own Laboratory Safety Plans.\n\nThis Laboratory Safety Manual is intended to establish basic safe operating practices so that faculty, staff, and students of KAUST may carry out effective educational and research programs in a safe and healthy environment. It is not intended to be a complete or final listing of all laboratory hazards or safe work practices. Because of the diverse nature of work being conducted at KAUST, additional procedures or requirements may be necessary for individual research labs.\n\nThe information contained within this laboratory safety manual is intended to comply with national regulations, international standards and laboratory best management practices.\n\nLABORATORY SAFETY PLAN\n\nEach laboratory where there is a risk of health or physical hazards is required to have a written Laboratory Safety Plan to protect against hazards to personnel, property, or the environment. This includes laboratories having hazardous materials (chemical, biological or radioactive), compressed gases, high-pressure, high-energy, Laser, X-Ray, or other significant physical, mechanical, or electrical hazards. The Laboratory Safety Plan should outline the lab-specific practices and procedures, personal protective equipment, training requirements, standard operating procedures, emergency procedures, and other safety requirements to protect employees from the hazards they may encounter in the laboratory. The Laboratory Safety Plan must be updated whenever there is a significant change in laboratory operations and/or hazards present, or a change in emergency contact personnel. A Laboratory Safety Plan template is available on the Lab Safety webpage.\n\n--- Page 7 ---",

These factors include the properties of the specific chemical (including toxicity), the dose and concentration of the chemical, the route of exposure, duration of exposure, individual susceptibility, and any other effects resulting from mixtures with other chemicals.\n\nIn order to understand how chemical hazards can affect you, it is important to first understand how chemicals can get into your body and do damage. The four main routes of entry are inhalation, ingestion, injection, and absorption through the skin and eyes.\n\nINHALATION\n\nInhalation of chemicals results in absorption of chemicals via the respiratory tract (lungs). Once chemicals have entered into the respiratory tract, the chemicals can then be absorbed into the bloodstream for distribution throughout the body. Chemicals can be inhaled in the form of vapors, fumes, mists, aerosols, and fine dust.\n\nSymptoms of exposure to chemicals through inhalation include eye, nose, and throat irritation, coughing, difficulty in breathing, headache, dizziness, confusion, and collapse. If any of these symptoms are noted, leave the area immediately and get fresh air. Seek medical attention if symptoms persist and complete an accident report using the online Report It System.\n\nLaboratory workers can protect themselves from chemical exposure via inhalation through proper use of a functioning fume hood, use of dust masks and respirators when a fume hood is not available, avoiding bench top use of hazardous chemicals, ensuring chemical containers are kept tightly capped, and ensuring all chemical spills are promptly cleaned up.\n\nINGESTION\n\nChemical exposure through ingestion occurs by absorption of chemicals through the digestive tract. Ingestion of chemicals can occur directly and indirectly. Direct ingestion can occur by accidentally eating or drinking a chemical. With proper housekeeping and labeling, the chances of this happening are greatly reduced.\n\nA higher of receiving exposure can occur when food or drink is consumed. This can also occur when food or drink is stored with chemicals, such as in a refrigerator. Ingestion can occur when a laboratory worker who handles chemicals\n\n--- Page 51 ---",

If necessary, a small amount of packing material (shipping peanuts, vermiculite, or cardboard inserts), that is compatible with the chemical(s), should be used to prevent bottles from tipping over or breaking during transport. You should have proper PPE accessible in the event of a spill.\n\n- Wheeled carts with lipped surfaces (such as Rubbermaid carts) should be used whenever feasible.\n\n- Do not use passenger elevators when transporting chemicals, only freight elevators should be used.\n\n- When transporting compressed gas cylinders, always use a proper gas cylinder hand truck with the cylinder strapped to the cart and keep the cap in place. NEVER roll or drag a compressed gas cylinder.\n\n- Avoid riding in passenger elevators with cryogenic liquids or compressed gas cylinders. Use a buddy system when transporting these materials. Have one person send the properly secured dewars or cylinders on the elevator, while the other person waits at the floor by the elevator doors where the dewars or cylinders will arrive.\n\nNOTE: IF YOU PLAN ON TRANSPORTING OR SHIPPING ANY HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS OFF CAMPUS, BE AWARE THERE ARE SPECIFIC PROCEDURES, TRAINING AND OTHER LEGAL REQUIREMENTS THAT MUST BE FOLLOWED.

Biohazard Spill Cleanup\n\nThe degree of risk involved with a spill depends on the volume of material spilled, the potential concentration of organisms in the material spilled, the hazard of the organisms involved, the route of infection of the organisms, and the diseases caused by the organisms.\n\nSpills of biological agents can contaminate areas and lead to infection of laboratory workers. Prevention of exposure is the primary goal in spill containment and cleanup – the same as with chemical spills. In evaluating the risks of spill response, generation of aerosols or droplets is a major consideration.\n\nIf an accident generates droplets or aerosols in the laboratory room atmosphere, especially if the agent involved requires containment at BSL-2, the following steps should be taken:\n\n1. Evacuate all personnel from the immediate area;\n2. Wait approximately 30 minutes for the aerosols to settle before entering the spill area;\n3. Remove any contaminated clothing and place in biohazard bag to be treated (autoclave or dispose);\n4. Wear a disposable gown, shoe covers, eye protection, and gloves;\n5. Initiate cleanup with disinfectant as follows:\n   a. Place paper towels over spill;\n   b. Pour an appropriate disinfectant solution onto paper towels – from the outside of the spill to the center;\n   c. Allow sufficient contact time for the disinfectant to work. Contact time is a function of the disinfectant used, disinfectant concentration, and the agent being cleaned up. This information should be included in the Lab Safety Plan;\n   d. Place cleanup materials into appropriate biohazard waste container(s) for disposal;\n   e. If broken glass is involved, use forceps or other mechanical device to collect the broken piece hands to glass. Place\n   f. Report the supervisor and incident in the system.\n\n7.3.

Seek medical attention if symptoms persist and complete an accident report using the online Report It System.\n\nLaboratory workers can protect themselves from chemical exposure via inhalation through proper use of a functioning fume hood, use of dust masks and respirators when a fume hood is not available, avoiding bench top use of hazardous chemicals, ensuring chemical containers are kept tightly capped, and ensuring all chemical spills are promptly cleaned up.\n\nINGESTION\n\nChemical exposure through ingestion occurs by absorption of chemicals through the digestive tract. Ingestion of chemicals can occur directly and indirectly. Direct ingestion can occur by accidentally eating or drinking a chemical. With proper housekeeping and labeling, the chances of this happening are greatly reduced.\n\nA higher of receiving exposure can occur when food or drink is consumed. This can also occur when food or drink is stored with chemicals, such as in a refrigerator. Ingestion can occur when a laboratory worker who handles chemicals\n\n--- Page 51 ---",

After calling 911, go back to assist the person using the shower and continue flushing for 15 minutes or until help arrives and have the person seek medical attention.\n\nNOTE: Although an emergency is no time for modesty, if a person is too modest and reluctant to use the emergency shower, you can assist them by using a lab coat or other piece of clothing or barrier to help ease their mind while they undress under the shower. If you are assisting someone else, you should wear gloves to avoid contaminating yourself. When using an emergency shower, do not be concerned about the damage from flooding. The important thing to remember is to keep flushing for 15 minutes.\n\nHYDROFLUORIC ACID (HF)\n\nHydrofluoric acid (HF) is corrosive and highly toxic. HF burns can be severe and extremely painful, causing extensive damage to the skin and eyes, and to the mucous membranes if breathed or swallowed. HF is absorbed quickly and can cause widespread damage to the body and even death. Any person contaminated with HF must have immediate first aid, followed by medical treatment from a physician as soon as possible.\n\n***All laboratories using hydrofluoric acid must have calcium gluconate gel readily available. Calcium gluconate can be obtained at the Chemical Warehouse.\n\nSKIN EXPOSURE\n\n1. Move the victim immediately under an emergency shower or other water source and flush the affected area with large amounts of cool running water. Immediately washing off the acid is of primary importance.\n\n2. Remove all contaminated clothing while flushing with water.\n\n3. While the victim is being rinsed with water, arrange for immediate emergency medical assistance by calling 911 from a campus phone or 012-808-0911 from a mobile phone.\n\n--- Page 19 ---",

Symptoms of eye exposure can include itchy or burning sensations, blurred vision, discomfort, and blindness. The best way to protect yourself from chemical splashes to the eyes is to always wear safety glasses in the laboratory whenever eye hazards exist (chemicals, glassware, lasers, etc.). If you are pouring large quantities of chemicals (>4 liters), then splash goggles are more appropriate than safety glasses. Whenever a severe splash hazard may exist, the use of a face shield, in combination with splash goggles is the best choice for protection. Please note, a face shield by itself does not provide adequate eye protection.\n\nIf you do get chemicals in your eyes, immediately go to an eyewash station and flush your eyes for at least 15 minutes. The importance of flushing for at least 15 minutes cannot be overstated! Once the eyewash has been activated, use your fingers to hold your eyelids open and roll your eyeballs in the stream of water so the entire eye can be flushed. After flushing for at least 15 minutes, seek medical attention immediately and complete an accident report using the online Report It System.\n\nSKIN ABSORPTION\n\nSymptoms of skin exposure to chemicals include dry, whitened skin, redness, swelling, rashes, blisters, itching, chemical burns, cuts, and defatting. Please note that some chemicals can be readily absorbed by the skin.\n\nLaboratory workers can protect their skin from chemical exposure by selecting and wearing the proper gloves, wearing a lab coat and other personal protective equipment for special hazards (such as protective sleeves, face shields, and aprons), and not wearing shorts and sandals in areas where chemicals are being used - even if you are not using chemicals, but someone else in the lab is using chemicals nearby.\n\nFor small chemical splashes to the skin, remove any contaminated gloves, lab coats, etc., and wash the affected area with soap and water for at least 15 minutes. Seek medical attention afterward, especially if symptoms persist.\n\nFor large chemical splashes to the body, it is important to get to an emergency shower and start flushing for at least 15 minutes. Once under the shower, and after the shower has been activated, it is equally important to remove any contaminated clothing.

Safety glasses do not provide adequate protection for processes that involve heavy chemical use such as stirring, pouring, or mixing. In these instances, splash goggles should be used. If you need prescription safety glasses, the research safety team has a bulletin describing how to purchase them.\n\nSPLASH GOGGLES\n\nSplash goggles provide adequate eye protection from many hazards, including potential chemical splash hazards, use of concentrated corrosive material, and bulk chemical transfer. Goggles are available with clear or tinted lenses, fog proofing, and vented or non-vented frames. Be aware that goggles designed for woodworking are not appropriate for working with chemicals. These former types of goggles can be identified by the numerous small holes throughout the facepiece. In the event of a splash, chemicals could enter into the small holes, and result in a chemical exposure to the face. Ensure the goggles you choose are rated for use with chemicals.\n\nFACE SHIELDS\n\nFace shields provide additional protection to the eyes and face when used in combination with safety glasses or splash goggles. Face shields consist of an adjustable headgear and face shield of tinted or clear lenses or a mesh wire screen. They should be used in operations when the entire face needs protection and should be worn to protect the eyes and face from flying particles, metal sparks, and chemical/biological splashes. Face shields must not be used alone and are not a substitute for appropriate eyewear. Face shields should always be worn in conjunction with a primary form of eye protection such as safety glasses or splash goggles.\n\nWELDING SHIELDS\n\nWelding shields are similar in design to face shields but offer additional protection from infrared or radiant light burns, flying sparks, metal splatter, and slag chips encountered during welding, brazing, soldering, and cutting operations. Equipment fitted with appropriate filter lenses must be used to protect against light. Tinted and are not filter\n\nLASER PROTECTION\n\nA single pair of safety glasses is not available for protection from all LASER outputs.

Regular activation (weekly flushing) ensures the units are operating properly, helps to keep the units free of clutter, and helps prevent the growth of bacteria within the plumbing lines, which can cause eye infections.\n\nLaboratories are responsible for ensuring that access to eyewashes and emergency showers are kept free of clutter and ensuring the eyewash nozzle dust covers are kept in place. If nozzle dust covers are not kept on the eyewash nozzles, dust or other particles can clog the nozzles and result in poor or no water flow. This could result in dust or other particles being forced into the eyes when the eyewash is used.\n\nAlways report any malfunctioning eyewashes and emergency showers to your manager immediately and submit a ticket through the Help Desk at 959 to have the unit repaired. If either the emergency shower or eyewash is not working properly, then let other people in the lab know by hanging up a \"Sign Off\" sign on the unit.\n\nLaboratory personnel should test eyewash and safety showers on a weekly basis. An eyewash/shower test can be found on the Signs and Labels webpage.\n\n--- Page 46 -",

Moreover, it is the vision of KAUST to be a leader among its peers in the international research community for its health, safety, and environmental performance.\n\nKAUST's commitment to health, safety, and environmental performance extends to all functions within the University. However, because of the special safety concerns that arise in a laboratory setting, this Laboratory Safety Manual has been developed by the Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) Department to serve as a general guide to laboratory safety within KAUST. It is to be used as a resource to assist laboratories in designing their own Laboratory Safety Plans.\n\nThis Laboratory Safety Manual is intended to establish basic safe operating practices so that faculty, staff, and students of KAUST may carry out effective educational and research programs in a safe and healthy environment. It is not intended to be a complete or final listing of all laboratory hazards or safe work practices. Because of the diverse nature of work being conducted at KAUST, additional procedures or requirements may be necessary for individual research labs.\n\nThe information contained within this laboratory safety manual is intended to comply with national regulations, international standards and laboratory best management practices.\n\nLABORATORY SAFETY PLAN\n\nEach laboratory where there is a risk of health or physical hazards is required to have a written Laboratory Safety Plan to protect against hazards to personnel, property, or the environment. This includes laboratories having hazardous materials (chemical, biological or radioactive), compressed gases, high-pressure, high-energy, Laser, X-Ray, or other significant physical, mechanical, or electrical hazards. The Laboratory Safety Plan should outline the lab-specific practices and procedures, personal protective equipment, training requirements, standard operating procedures, emergency procedures, and other safety requirements to protect employees from the hazards they may encounter in the laboratory. The Laboratory Safety Plan must be updated whenever there is a significant change in laboratory operations and/or hazards present, or a change in emergency contact personnel. A Laboratory Safety Plan template is available on the Lab Safety webpage.\n\n--- Page 7 ---",

The setup should allow for fast removal of heat.\n- Whenever hazardous gases or fumes are likely to be evolved, an appropriate gas trap should be used and the operation confined to a fume hood.\n- Fume hoods are recommended for all operations in which toxic or flammable vapors are evolved as is the case with many distillations. Most vapors have a density greater than air and will settle on a bench top or floor where they may diffuse to a distant burner or ignition source. These vapors can roll out over long distances and, if flammable, an ignition can cause a flashback to the source of vapors. Once diluted with significant amounts of air, vapors move in air essentially as air itself.\n- Use a hood when working with a system under reduced pressure (which may implode). Close the sash to provide a shield. If a hood is not available, use a standing shield. Shields that can be knocked over must be stabilized with weights or fasteners. Standing shields are preferably secured near the top. Proper eye and face protection must be worn even when using safety shields or fume hoods.\n\nREFRIGERATORS AND FREEZERS\n\nThe potential hazards posed by laboratory refrigerators and freezers involve vapors from the contents, the possible presence of incompatible chemicals and spillage.\n\nOnly refrigerators and freezers specified for laboratory use should be utilized for the storage of chemicals. These refrigerators have been constructed with special design factors, such as heavy-duty cords and corrosion resistant interiors to help reduce the risk of fire or explosions in the lab.\n\nStandard refrigerators have electrical fans and motors that make them potential ignition sources for flammable vapors. Do not store flammable liquids in a refrigerator unless it is approved for such storage. Flammable liquid-approved refrigerators are designed with spark-producing parts on the outside to avoid accidental ignition. If refrigeration is needed inside a flammable-storage room, you should use an explosion-proof refrigerator.\n\nFrost-free refrigerators should also be avoided. Many of them have a drain or tube or hole that carries water and possibly any spilled materials to an area near the compressor, which may spark.

Be sure to check chemical containers regularly and replace any labels that are deteriorating or falling off and/or re-label with another label before the chemical becomes an unknown.\n- Chemical storage in fume hoods should be kept to a minimum - limited to the experiment being conducted. Excess storage of chemical containers in hoods can interfere with airflow, reduced working space, and increase the risk of a spill, fire, or explosion.\n- For chemical storage cabinets, larger chemical bottles should be stored towards the back and smaller bottles should be stored up front where they are visible. Chemical bottles should be turned with the labels facing out so they can be easily read.\n- Chemicals should not be stored on the floor due to the potential for bottles to be knocked over which could result in a spill. If it is necessary to store bottles on the floor, then the bottles must be placed in a secondary containment, such as trays, and the bottles should be placed away from aisle spaces.\n- For multiples of the same chemical, older containers should be stored in front of newer chemicals and containers with the least amount of chemical should be stored in front of full containers. This allows for older chemicals to get used up first and helps to minimize the number of chemical containers in the storage area.\n- Do not store chemicals in direct sunlight or next to heat sources.\n- All chemical containers shall remain closed when not in use.\n- Lab chemicals shall be procured in container sizes that are easy to handle and manipulate. Chemicals should not be obtained in larger size containers unless there is an approved method for transfer (pump, dispensing apparatus, etc.).\n- Liquid chemical containers should be stored in secondary containment, such as trays, to minimize the potential for bottle breakage and minimize the potential for spills.\n- Always segregate and store chemicals according to compatibility and hazard classes.\n- Chemical containers should be dated when they arrive and should be checked regularly and disposed of when they get past their expiration date. Please Note: Due to the potential explosion hazard, peroxide forming chemicals should be dated when received and 1st opened, and then tested every six months. See Appendix 8 for more information on peroxide forming chemicals.\n- Flammable and Combustible Liquid Storage. For flammable and combustible liquids, the age of flammable and combustible liquids should be protected according to the regulations of NFPA 45.\n- Flammable or Combustible Liquid Limits (1 per lab unit):\n- 1 Per NFPA 45 a lab unit is defined as a separate fire area.

Iron rings are not acceptable supports for hot baths.\n- Clamp equipment high enough above a hot bath that if the reaction begins to overheat, the bath can be lowered immediately and replaced with a cooling bath without having to readjust the equipment setup.\n- Provide secondary containment in the event of a spill of hot oil.\n- Wear heat-resistant gloves when handling a hot bath.\n- The reaction container used in a molten salt bath must be able to withstand a very rapid heat-up to a temperature above the melting point of salt.\n- Since combustible liquids are often used in heat baths, the thermostat should be set so the temperature never rises above the flash point of the liquid. Check the SDS for the chemical to determine the flashpoint. Compare that flashpoint with the expected temperature of the reaction to gauge risk of starting a fire.\nSee the Guidelines for Working with Hot Oil Baths and Other Heating Sources on the Lab Safety webpage for more information.\n\nHOT AIR BATHS AND TUBE FURNACES\n\nHot air baths are used in the lab as heating devices. Nitrogen is preferred for reactions involving flammable materials. Electrically heated air baths are frequently used to heat small or irregularly-shaped vessels. One drawback of the hot air bath is that they have a low heat capacity. As a result, these baths normally have to be heated to 100°C or more above the target temperature. Tube furnaces are often used for high-temperature reactions under pressure.

If flammable gases are likely to be released in any process, the experiment must be confined to a chemical hood. A blast/explosion shield may also be required.\n\n2. Date all peroxide-forming chemicals (e.g. diethyl ether, THF, dioxane) when they are received and when they need to be disposed. Peroxide formers should not be stored past their expiration date. Purchased peroxide formers generally contain inhibitors (BHT) to prevent the formation of peroxides. Any distilled or processed peroxide former no longer contains these inhibitors and should be kept under inert conditions, used immediately or disposed.\n\n3. Do not pour any flammable liquids into sinks to be washed down with water. Fires and explosions have been caused in laboratories by vapors returning through the drainage system (e.g., during aspiration or rotary evaporation).\n\nREACTIVE SUBSTANCES\n\n1. When conducting a reaction where there is any possibility of even a mild explosion, use a face shield that is sufficiently large and strong to protect the face and neck, or use a standing blast/explosion shield. Splash goggles must be worn even when using a shield.\n\n2. When sodium, potassium, or lithium is used, the cuttings or residual pieces must be properly disposed immediately. Store any of these metals in oil, toluene, xylene, or other saturated hydrocarbon with a high boiling point. These hydrocarbon solvents must be dry.\n\n3. Never leave unattended chemical reactions that have not achieved kinetic equilibrium.\n\nCORROSIVE SUBSTANCES\n\n1. Always pour acid into water, never water into acid, as it can cause an exothermic reaction. For the same reason, pour concentrated solutions into water or less concentrated solutions while stirring.\n\n2. Keep corrosive spills clean up immediately.

The instruction should cover the operating procedures written by the manufacturer or laboratory, as well as the associated hazards, the correct personal protective equipment, and applicable emergency procedures.\n\nThe following are guidelines to assist researchers in safely operating electrophoresis units:\n\n- Place electrophoresis units and their power supplies so that the on/off switch is easy to reach and the power-indicator lights are easily seen. Locate the equipment where it will not be easy to knock or trip over.\n- Routinely inspect electrophoresis units and their power supplies to ensure they are working properly. Power supplies should be inspected to ensure that all switches and lights are in proper working condition, that power cords and leads are undamaged and properly insulated. Power supplies for electrophoresis units should be protected by Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs).\n- Inspect the buffer tanks for cracks or leaks, exposed connectors, or missing covers.\n- Turn the power off before connecting the electrical leads. Do not override safety devices. Connect one lead at a time, using one hand only. Ensure that hands are dry while connecting leads.\n- Keep the apparatus away from sinks or other water sources.\n- Turn off power before opening the lid or reaching inside the chamber.\n- Do not leave electrophoresis units unattended for long periods of time since unauthorized persons may accidentally come in contact with the unit, or the buffer tank liquid may evaporate, resulting in risk of fire.\n- Laboratories that perform electrophoresis work during off hours should consider using a \"buddy system\" to ensure that emergency services can be notified if someone is injured or exposed.\n- If using acrylamide, purchase premixed solutions or pre-weighed quantities whenever possible.\n- If using ethidium bromide, have a hand-held UV light source available in the laboratory. Check working surfaces after each use.\n- Mix solutions in a fume hood.\n- Decontaminate surfaces with ethanol. Dispose of all cleanup materials as hazardous waste.\n\n--- Page 111 ---",

When cleaning up spills, remember to clean up any splashes that may have occurred on the sides of cabinets and doors in the immediate area.\n11. When working in cold rooms, keep all toxic and flammable substances tightly closed as cold rooms have recirculated atmospheres.\n12. Be aware of the potential asphyxiation hazard when using cryogenic materials and compressed gases in confined areas such as cold rooms and environmental chambers. If necessary, install an oxygen monitor/oxygen deficiency alarm and/or toxic gas monitor before working with these materials in confined areas.\n13. Do not eat, drink, chew gum, or apply cosmetics in areas where hazardous chemicals are being used.\n14. Keep all food and drink out of refrigerators and freezers used to store chemicals. Refrigerators used to store chemicals should be labeled as \"Chemicals Only – No Food\". Refrigerator signs can be found on the Lab Safety Signs and Labels webpage.\n15. Always wash hands with soap and water after handling chemicals and especially before leaving the lab and eating – even if gloves were worn during chemical handling.\n16. Always remove personal protective equipment, such as gloves and lab coats, before leaving the lab.\n17. Do not attempt to scale up experiments until after you have run the experiment according to published protocols and you are thoroughly familiar with the potential hazards. General rule of thumb: Always scale up 3-5 fold each step. When scaling up an experiment – change only one variable at a time, i.e. don’t change the heat source, the solvent, and the chemical lot number all at once. It is also advisable to let one of your other lab group members to check your setup prior to each run.\n18. Always conduct procedures involving volatile chemicals, and those involving solid or liquid cht may result in the generation of aerosols or dust in a lab.

The symptoms and effects listed are the effects of exposure at hazardous levels. Most chemicals are safe in normal use and the vast majority of workers never suffer toxic effects. However, any chemical can be toxic in high concentrations, and the precautions outlined in the SDS should be followed.\n\nThe health hazards section often contains information on the toxicity of the substance. The data most often presented are the results of animal experiments. For example, \"LD50 (mouse) = 250 mg/kg.\" The usual measure of toxicity is a dose level expressed as weight of chemical per unit body weight of the animal-usually milligrams of chemical per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg). The LD50 describes the amount of chemical ingested or absorbed by the skin in test animals that causes death in 50% of test animals used during a toxicity test study. Another common term is LC50, which describes the amount of chemical inhaled by test animals that causes death in 50% of test animals used during a toxicity test study. The LD50 and LC50 values are then used to infer what dose is required to show a toxic effect on humans.\n\n--- Page 143 ---",

Chronic toxicity can also result in acute exposures, with long-term chronic effects.\n\nEVALUATING TOXICITY DATA\n\nSDSs and other chemical resources generally refer to the toxicity of a chemical numerically using the term Lethal Dose 50 (LD50). The LD50 describes the amount of chemical ingested or absorbed by the skin in test animals that causes death in 50% of test animals used during a toxicity test study. Another common term is Lethal Concentration 50 (LC50), which describes the amount of chemical inhaled by test animals that causes death in 50% of test animals used during a toxicity test study. The LD50 and LC50 values are then used to infer what dose is required to show a toxic effect on humans.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, the lower the LD50 or LC50 number, the more toxic the chemical. Note there are other factors (concentration of the chemical, frequency of exposure, etc.) that contribute to the toxicity of a chemical, including other hazards the chemical may possess.\n\nWhile exact toxic effects of a chemical on test animals cannot necessarily be directly correlated with toxic effects on humans, the LD50 and LC50 can give a good indication of the toxicity of a chemical, particularly in comparison to another chemical. For example, when making a decision on what chemical to use in an experiment based on safety for the lab worker, a chemical with a high LD50 or LC50 would be safer to work with, assuming the chemical did not possess multiple hazards and everything else being equal. In addition to having a toxic effect on the body, some chemicals can be carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic, and acutely toxic.\n\nIn general terms, the resource Prudent Practices in the Laboratory lists the following table for evaluating the relevant toxicity of a chemical:\n\n| Toxicity Class | Animal LD50 | Probable Lethal Dose for 70 kg Person (150 lbs.) | Example |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Super Toxic | Less than 5 mg/kg | A taste (7 drops or less) | Botulinum toxin |\n| Extremely Toxic | 5 - 50 mg/kg | < 1 teaspoonful | Arsenic trioxide, Strychnine |\n| Toxic | 50 - 500 mg/kg | 1 teaspoonful | Phenol, Carbon tetrachloride |\n| Moderately Toxic | 500 - 5000 mg/kg | 1 tablespoonful | Aspirin, Sodium bicarbonate |\n| Slightly Toxic | 5 - 15 g/kg | < 0.9 L (1 quart) | Ethyl alcohol, Acetone |\n\n--- Page 55 ---",

Biosafety Containment Levels\n\nIn contrast to Risk Groups, Biosafety Levels (BSL) prescribe practices, procedures and levels of containment for the particular biohazard. The most important element of containment is strict adherence to standard microbiological practices and techniques. Similar to Risk Groups, BSL are graded from 1 through 4. The four levels of biosafety, designated in ascending order by degree of protection provided to personnel, the environment, and the community, are combinations of laboratory practices, safety equipment, and laboratory facilities. The BMBL recommends that work be done using one of four levels of containment: Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1), BSL-2, BSL-3, and BSL-4.\n\nIt is KAUST policy that all laboratories adhere to these BMBL and NIH guidelines\n\nThe primary risk criteria used to define the four ascending levels of containment are:\n- Infectivity;\n- Severity of disease;\n- Transmissibility;\n- The nature of the work being conducted.\n\nThe majority of work at KAUST involves Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1) and 2 (BSL-2) practices. BSL-2 containment and practices are suitable for work with agents that are infectious to humans or animals where exposure may result in limited to moderate disease. The routes of exposure to these agents are typically through cuts and breaks in the skin, ingestion, and splashes to the mucous membranes (eye, mouth). These agents include:\n- Human blood, blood components, fluids, unfixed organs, tissues and cell lines (primary and established);\n- Biotoxins (with a LD50 of less than 100 micrograms per kilogram of body weight in\n\n--- Page 9 ---",

The toxicity of HF is the main concern.\n\nHF is absorbed through the skin quickly and is a severe systemic toxin. The fluoride ion binds calcium in the blood, bones and other organs and causes damage to tissues that is very painful and can be lethal. At the emergency room, the victim is often given calcium injections, but pain medication is not generally given since the pain subsiding is the only indication that the calcium injections are working.\n\nDue to the serious hazard of working with HF, the following requirements and guidelines are provided:\n\n- All users of HF must attend the HSE Hydrofluoric Acid Safety training as well as training by their supervisor. Dates for upcoming training sessions can be found on the Lab Safety Training Calendar.\n\n- A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) must be written for the process in which HF is used. This SOP should be posted or readily available near the designated area where HF use will occur.\n\n- HF should only be used in a designated fume hood and the fume hood should be identified by posting a HF Designated Area sign. An example sign can be found on the Lab Safety Signs and Labels webpage.\n\n- First Aid - A HF first aid kit must be available that includes 2.5% calcium gluconate gel. The calcium gluconate gel can be purchased from the Chemical Warehouse. Calcium gluconate gel should be located in the immediate area where HF is used.\n\n- Spill Kits - An HF spill kit must be available with calcium compounds such as calcium carbonate. Sodium bicarbonate can be used but is discouraged since the product of neutralization (sodium fluoride) is water soluble and toxic. Calcium carbonate neutralizes HF to create an insoluble salt that is not water soluble.\n\n- Prior approval - Before anyone uses HF they must have prior approval from their Principal Investigator. The Principal Investigator should ensure anyone working with HF is familiar with the following:\n\n    o Has read the SDS for HF and the Guidelines for Use of HF, and any SOPs developed by the lab.\n\n    o Has read the hydrofluoric acid section in this Lab Safety Manual.\n\n    o Is a designated area for HF use.\n\n    o Knows the procedures for an HF exposure.\n\n    o Is aware of the area for HF use.\n\n    o Knows the first aid procedures in case of an HF spill.\n\n- Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and lab attire - The following is required for HF use:\n\n    o Rubber or plastic apron.\n\n--- Page 76 ---",

The setup should allow for fast removal of heat.\n- Whenever hazardous gases or fumes are likely to be evolved, an appropriate gas trap should be used and the operation confined to a fume hood.\n- Fume hoods are recommended for all operations in which toxic or flammable vapors are evolved as is the case with many distillations. Most vapors have a density greater than air and will settle on a bench top or floor where they may diffuse to a distant burner or ignition source. These vapors can roll out over long distances and, if flammable, an ignition can cause a flashback to the source of vapors. Once diluted with significant amounts of air, vapors move in air essentially as air itself.\n- Use a hood when working with a system under reduced pressure (which may implode). Close the sash to provide a shield. If a hood is not available, use a standing shield. Shields that can be knocked over must be stabilized with weights or fasteners. Standing shields are preferably secured near the top. Proper eye and face protection must be worn even when using safety shields or fume hoods.\n\nREFRIGERATORS AND FREEZERS\n\nThe potential hazards posed by laboratory refrigerators and freezers involve vapors from the contents, the possible presence of incompatible chemicals and spillage.\n\nOnly refrigerators and freezers specified for laboratory use should be utilized for the storage of chemicals. These refrigerators have been constructed with special design factors, such as heavy-duty cords and corrosion resistant interiors to help reduce the risk of fire or explosions in the lab.\n\nStandard refrigerators have electrical fans and motors that make them potential ignition sources for flammable vapors. Do not store flammable liquids in a refrigerator unless it is approved for such storage. Flammable liquid-approved refrigerators are designed with spark-producing parts on the outside to avoid accidental ignition. If refrigeration is needed inside a flammable-storage room, you should use an explosion-proof refrigerator.\n\nFrost-free refrigerators should also be avoided. Many of them have a drain or tube or hole that carries water and possibly any spilled materials to an area near the compressor, which may spark.

Be sure to check chemical containers regularly and replace any labels that are deteriorating or falling off and/or re-label with another label before the chemical becomes an unknown.\n- Chemical storage in fume hoods should be kept to a minimum - limited to the experiment being conducted. Excess storage of chemical containers in hoods can interfere with airflow, reduced working space, and increase the risk of a spill, fire, or explosion.\n- For chemical storage cabinets, larger chemical bottles should be stored towards the back and smaller bottles should be stored up front where they are visible. Chemical bottles should be turned with the labels facing out so they can be easily read.\n- Chemicals should not be stored on the floor due to the potential for bottles to be knocked over which could result in a spill. If it is necessary to store bottles on the floor, then the bottles must be placed in a secondary containment, such as trays, and the bottles should be placed away from aisle spaces.\n- For multiples of the same chemical, older containers should be stored in front of newer chemicals and containers with the least amount of chemical should be stored in front of full containers. This allows for older chemicals to get used up first and helps to minimize the number of chemical containers in the storage area.\n- Do not store chemicals in direct sunlight or next to heat sources.\n- All chemical containers shall remain closed when not in use.\n- Lab chemicals shall be procured in container sizes that are easy to handle and manipulate. Chemicals should not be obtained in larger size containers unless there is an approved method for transfer (pump, dispensing apparatus, etc.).\n- Liquid chemical containers should be stored in secondary containment, such as trays, to minimize the potential for bottle breakage and minimize the potential for spills.\n- Always segregate and store chemicals according to compatibility and hazard classes.\n- Chemical containers should be dated when they arrive and should be checked regularly and disposed of when they get past their expiration date. Please Note: Due to the potential explosion hazard, peroxide forming chemicals should be dated when received and 1st opened, and then tested every six months. See Appendix 8 for more information on peroxide forming chemicals.\n- Flammable and Combustible Liquid Storage.

Iron rings are not acceptable supports for hot baths.\n- Clamp equipment high enough above a hot bath that if the reaction begins to overheat, the bath can be lowered immediately and replaced with a cooling bath without having to readjust the equipment setup.\n- Provide secondary containment in the event of a spill of hot oil.\n- Wear heat-resistant gloves when handling a hot bath.\n- The reaction container used in a molten salt bath must be able to withstand a very rapid heat-up to a temperature above the melting point of salt.\n- Since combustible liquids are often used in heat baths, the thermostat should be set so the temperature never rises above the flash point of the liquid. Check the SDS for the chemical to determine the flashpoint. Compare that flashpoint with the expected temperature of the reaction to gauge risk of starting a fire.\nSee the Guidelines for Working with Hot Oil Baths and Other Heating Sources on the Lab Safety webpage for more information.\n\nHOT AIR BATHS AND TUBE FURNACES\n\nHot air baths are used in the lab as heating devices. Nitrogen is preferred for reactions involving flammable materials. Electrically heated air baths are frequently used to heat small or irregularly-shaped vessels. One drawback of the hot air bath is that they have a low heat capacity. As a result, these baths normally have to be heated to 100°C or more above the target temperature. Tube furnaces are often used for high-temperature reactions under pressure.

If flammable gases are likely to be released in any process, the experiment must be confined to a chemical hood. A blast/explosion shield may also be required.\n\n2. Date all peroxide-forming chemicals (e.g. diethyl ether, THF, dioxane) when they are received and when they need to be disposed. Peroxide formers should not be stored past their expiration date. Purchased peroxide formers generally contain inhibitors (BHT) to prevent the formation of peroxides. Any distilled or processed peroxide former no longer contains these inhibitors and should be kept under inert conditions, used immediately or disposed.\n\n3. Do not pour any flammable liquids into sinks to be washed down with water. Fires and explosions have been caused in laboratories by vapors returning through the drainage system (e.g., during aspiration or rotary evaporation).\n\nREACTIVE SUBSTANCES\n\n1. When conducting a reaction where there is any possibility of even a mild explosion, use a face shield that is sufficiently large and strong to protect the face and neck, or use a standing blast/explosion shield. Splash goggles must be worn even when using a shield.\n\n2. When sodium, potassium, or lithium is used, the cuttings or residual pieces must be properly disposed immediately. Store any of these metals in oil, toluene, xylene, or other saturated hydrocarbon with a high boiling point. These hydrocarbon solvents must be dry.\n\n3. Never leave unattended chemical reactions that have not achieved kinetic equilibrium.\n\nCORROSIVE SUBSTANCES\n\n1.

These mantles enclose a heating element in a series of layers of fiberglass cloth. As long as the fiberglass coating is not worn or broken, and as long as no water or other chemicals are spilled into the mantle, heating mantles pose no shock hazard.\n\n- Always use a heating mantle with a variable autotransformer to control the input voltage.\n- Be sure to plug the heating mantle into the variable transformer and NOT directly into an outlet.\n- Be careful not to exceed the input voltage recommended by the mantle manufacturer. Higher voltages will cause it to overheat, melt the fiberglass insulation and expose the bare heating element.\n- If the heating mantle has an outer metal case that provides physical protection against damage to the fiberglass, it is good practice to ground the outer metal case to protect against an electric shock if the heating element inside the mantle shorts against the metal case.\n\nOIL, SALT AND SAND BATHS\n\nElectrically heated oil baths are often used to heat small or irregularly-shaped vessels or when a stable heat source that can be maintained at a constant temperature is desired. Molten salt baths (like hot oil baths) offer the advantages of good heat transfer, higher operating range (e.g., 200°C to 425°C) and high thermal stability (e.g., 540°C). But these last two advantages don’t always occur.\n\nThere are several precautions to take when working with these types of heating devices:\n\n- Heating baths should be durable and set up with firm support.\n- Take care with heating. Check flash point. Make or buy\n- Takhot oil baths generate\n- Always monitor oil baths by using a thermometer or other thermal sensing device to ensure that its temperature does not exceed the flash point of the oil being used.\n- Fit oil baths left unattended with thermal sensing devices that will turn off the electric power if the bath overheats.\n\n--- Page 102 ---",

          "content": "\n\nPROTECTIVE CLOTHING\n\nProtective clothing includes laboratory coats or other protective garments such as disposable coveralls, chemical splash aprons, and other items that can be used to protect street clothing from biological or chemical contamination and splashes, as well as providing additional body protection from some physical hazards.\n\nLaboratory coats must always be worn during active work in the laboratory that involves hazardous materials. A lab coat helps prevent contact with minor chemical splashes or spills encountered in laboratory-scale work. Laboratory coats do not significantly resist penetration by many liquid chemicals. Remove your lab coat immediately upon significant contamination. Do not take lab coats home and launder them because of the potential for contamination of the home environment. KAUST offers a laundry service for lab coats – see the Lab Services Bulletin on the Lab Safety webpage for more information.\n\nLab coats should remain buttoned to protect more completely. Laboratory coats are loose-fitting by design, so that in case of chemical contact there is ample time to react before it contacts the skin. Lab coats provide minimum protection. In some cases, disposable outer garments (e.g. Tyvek) may be necessary. Many disposable garments, however, offer only limited protection from vapor penetration and you need to exercise considerable judgment when using them. Impervious suits fully enclosing the body may be necessary in emergencies.\n\nPlease note: shorts (short skirts and similar clothing, etc.) and open toed shoes (sandals, flip flops, etc.) are not permitted in KAUST laboratories. See the PPE Standard for KAUST Laboratories for more information.\n\nRESPIRATORS\n\nRespiratory protection includes disposable respirators (such as N95 filtering facemasks commonly referred to as “dust masks”), air purifying, and atmosphere supplying respirators. Respirators are generally not recommended for laboratory workers. Engineering controls, such as dilution ventilation, fume hoods, and other devices, which capture and remove vapors, fumes, and gases from the breathing zone of the user are preferred over the use of respirators in most laboratory environments. There are certain exceptions to this general rule, such as the changing out of cylinders of toxic gases and emergency response to chemical spills.\n\nThe use of disposable respirators (e.g., N95 filtering facepieces/dust masks) for respirating powdery materials is, however, against the recommendation of the occupational exposure nuisance. As the worker protective equipment for use by workers, disposable respirators have limitations for use by workers, and the use of disposable respirators is only recommended until other decontamination working surfaces.\n\nA laboratory worker at KAUST may not purchase a respirator and bring it to their lab for personal use without prior consultation with HSE.\n\n--- Page 38 ---",

The minimum PPE for a laboratory is safety glasses, a buttoned laboratory coat and appropriate gloves. Depending on activities being conducted, additional PPE may be required. For additional information, see the PPE Standard for KAUST Laboratories.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS\n\nLaboratory personnel should conduct hazard assessments of specific operations occurring in their laboratories to determine what PPE is necessary to safely carry out the operations. Information on the specific PPE required to carry out procedures within the laboratory using hazardous chemicals must also be included in the laboratory’s standard operating procedures. PPE must be made available to laboratory workers to reduce exposures to hazardous chemicals in the lab. Proper PPE includes items such as gloves, eye protection, lab coats, face shields, aprons, boots, hearing protection, etc.\n\nWhen deciding on the appropriate PPE to wear when performing any operations or experiments, a number of factors must be taken into consideration such as:\n\n- The chemicals being used, including concentration and quantity.\n- The hazards the chemicals pose.\n- The routes of exposure for the chemicals.\n- The material the PPE is constructed of.\n- The permeation and degradation rates specific chemicals will have on the material.\n- The length of time the PPE will be in contact with the chemicals.\n\nCareful consideration should be given to the comfort and fit of PPE to ensure that it will be used by laboratory personnel. All personal protective equipment and clothing must be maintained in a sanitary and reliable condition. KAUST provides a laundry service for laboratory coats.\n\nWhile HSE can provide information, training, and assistance with conducting hazard assessments the selection of proper PPE is the responsibility of the investigator or laboratory principal. The ability lies with the investigator or laboratory principal to determine the appropriate use of PPE. Please Note: Principal Investigators, laboratory managers, and centers are free to set policies that establish minimum PPE requirements for personnel working in and entering their laboratories above the KAUST minimum standards.\n\n--- Page 31 ---",

Examples include ghutrah, shemaghs, veils, scarves, hijabs, turbans, head wraps, etc. Females who wear a hijab should wear hijabs made from 100% cotton. Loose flowing ends of such clothing must be tied securely and tucked under the lab coat.\n- Loose hanging clothing that is not confined by the use of a lab coat is forbidden due to its increased ability to snag/catch/entangle onto objects. Examples include articles such as robes, abayas, thobes, very loose arm sleeves, etc. If this type of clothing is worn, then a lab coat must be employed to reduce this hazard. Further, loose hanging clothing that touches the floor is also unacceptable.\n- Long and loose hair. Hair that falls beyond shoulder length needs to be secured to avoid being caught in any moving equipment or from falling into any hazardous material.\n- Loose or dangling jewelry. Similar to loose hair, loose and dangling jewelry provides a snagging hazard. In addition, all forms of metallic jewelry must be avoided while working near exposed and live electrical circuitry, as metals are great conductors of electricity.\n\nSTANDARD BASELINE OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT\n\nProper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) must be worn at all times in the laboratory while working with or being near hazards. Just because one is not working with a hazard does not mean one cannot be exposed to a hazard. Many accidental exposures simply involve those within the vicinity of a hazard. This is the rationale behind why a baseline level of PPE is required of all personnel inside KAUST laboratories. Housekeeping, maintenance, and hazardous waste personnel are exempt from lab coat usage as they do not perform laboratory work, and their uniform is cleaned through a laundry service.\n\nEyewear – The eyes are highly delicate and naturally vulnerable, making them susceptible to serious injury. To minimize risk, all personnel working in or passing through laboratory spaces with potential hazards must wear appropriate protective eyewear at all times. If you need prescription safety glasses, the research safety team has a bulletin describing how to purchase them.\n\nLab coat – Lab coats must be worn while working with or around hazards in the laboratory. Furthermore, lab coats must not be worn outside the laboratory as this may spread possible contaminants. KAUST provides a laundry service for laboratory coats.\n\nGloves – Since most operations in a laboratory require the use of hands, the use of gloves as PPE is of paramount importance to reduce exposure to hazards. Gloves must be worn while working directly with hazards and should be removed immediately after work with the hazard is done or after any sign of contamination appears. PPE is only a temporary barrier and must be removed immediately after performing a task, followed by handwashing. Tratough times may be not permanent barriers, and many hazards will eventually penetrate, given er, just arra Changing gloves frequently and often is a good practice to prevent orso gloveemiers significant exposure. Often also helps to prevent spreading contamination to other areas in the lab.\n\nRespirators – The use of respirators should only be used when the use of engineering controls (e.g., fume hoods) is not practical. Engineering controls are the preferred method to prevent exposure to hazardous materials. If engineering controls are not practical or feasible, then the use of a respirator can be employed, but before one uses a respirator, one must be enrolled in the Respiratory Protection Program, which requires;\n\n--- Page 2 ---",

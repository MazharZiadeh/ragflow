Principal Investigators, faculty, and lab managers have numerous resources available to them for helping to ensure a safe and healthy laboratory.\n\nIt is the responsibility of Principal Investigators and laboratory managers to ensure that all persons in the laboratory are familiar both with this Laboratory Safety Manual and the relevant Laboratory Safety Plan, and are properly trained and competent to safely carry out their job duties and research.\n\nRESEARCH CENTER DIRECTORS AND PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS (PIs)\n\nResearch center directors and Principal Investigators are accountable for the health and safety of employees engaged in activities under their supervision. This responsibility cannot be delegated. To fulfill this responsibility, they should be familiar with KAUST's HSE policy and this Laboratory Safety Manual. Their responsibilities include:\n\n- Communicate and implement KAUST's HSE policy and the Lab Safety Manual requirements to faculty, staff, visiting scholars and students working in laboratories within their units;\n- Ensure laboratory personnel know and follow the guidelines and requirements contained within the KAUST Laboratory Safety Manual;\n- Ensure laboratory personnel develop and adhere to proper health and safety protocols.\n- Support staff participation on campus, center, and lab safety committee(s); training programs; and safety meetings;\n- Ensure that laboratory personnel are prepared and trained to handle and dispose of hazardous substances used in their laboratories are written, communicated, and followed. Ensure laboratory personnel are familiar with the relevant Laboratory Safety Plan and are trained to handle and dispose of hazardous substances used in their laboratories.\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nID: 40\n├── Title: laboratory_safety_manual.pdf\n└── Content:\n\n\nPPE TRAINING\n\nLaboratory personnel must be trained in the selection, proper use, limitations, care, and maintenance of PPE. Training requirements can be met in a variety of ways including videos, group training sessions, and handouts. Periodic retraining should be offered to both the employees and supervisors as appropriate. Examples of topics to be covered during the training include:\n\n- When PPE must be worn.\n- What PPE is necessary to carry out a procedure or experiment.\n- How to properly put on, take off, adjust, and wear PPE.\n- The proper cleaning, care, maintenance, useful life, limitations, and disposal of the PPE.\n\nIt is the responsibility of Principal Investigators and laboratory managers to ensure laboratory staff and students have received the appropriate training on the selection and use of proper PPE, that proper PPE is available and in good condition, and laboratory personnel use proper PPE when working in laboratories under their supervision.\n\nEYE PROTECTION\n\nEye protection is one of the most important and easiest forms of PPE to wear. Laboratory personnel must use eye protection for many of the chemical and physical hazards found in laboratories including flying particles, broken glass, molten metal, acids or caustic liquids, chemical liquids, chemical gases or vapors, or potentially injurious light radiation.\n\nAppropriate eye protection is required whenever working in or entering a laboratory in which hazardous chemical or infectious materials, or other mechanical or physical eye hazards are present.

Moreover, it is the vision of KAUST to be a leader among its peers in the international research community for its health, safety, and environmental performance.\n\nKAUST's commitment to health, safety, and environmental performance extends to all functions within the University. However, because of the special safety concerns that arise in a laboratory setting, this Laboratory Safety Manual has been developed by the Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) Department to serve as a general guide to laboratory safety within KAUST. It is to be used as a resource to assist laboratories in designing their own Laboratory Safety Plans.\n\nThis Laboratory Safety Manual is intended to establish basic safe operating practices so that faculty, staff, and students of KAUST may carry out effective educational and research programs in a safe and healthy environment. It is not intended to be a complete or final listing of all laboratory hazards or safe work practices. Because of the diverse nature of work being conducted at KAUST, additional procedures or requirements may be necessary for individual research labs.\n\nThe information contained within this laboratory safety manual is intended to comply with national regulations, international standards and laboratory best management practices.\n\nLABORATORY SAFETY PLAN\n\nEach laboratory where there is a risk of health or physical hazards is required to have a written Laboratory Safety Plan to protect against hazards to personnel, property, or the environment. This includes laboratories having hazardous materials (chemical, biological or radioactive), compressed gases, high-pressure, high-energy, Laser, X-Ray, or other significant physical, mechanical, or electrical hazards. The Laboratory Safety Plan should outline the lab-specific practices and procedures, personal protective equipment, training requirements, standard operating procedures, emergency procedures, and other safety requirements to protect employees from the hazards they may encounter in the laboratory. The Laboratory Safety Plan must be updated whenever there is a significant change in laboratory operations and/or hazards present, or a change in emergency contact personnel. A Laboratory Safety Plan template is available on the Lab Safety webpage.\n\n--- Page 7 ---"

Training requirements can be met in a variety of ways including videos, group training sessions, and handouts. Periodic retraining should be offered to both the employees and supervisors as appropriate. Examples of topics to be covered during the training include:\n\n- When PPE must be worn.\n- What PPE is necessary to carry out a procedure or experiment.\n- How to properly put on, take off, adjust, and wear PPE.\n- The proper cleaning, care, maintenance, useful life, limitations, and disposal of the PPE.\n\nIt is the responsibility of Principal Investigators and laboratory managers to ensure laboratory staff and students have received the appropriate training on the selection and use of proper PPE, that proper PPE is available and in good condition, and laboratory personnel use proper PPE when working in laboratories under their supervision.\n\nEYE PROTECTION\n\nEye protection is one of the most important and easiest forms of PPE to wear. Laboratory personnel must use eye protection for many of the chemical and physical hazards found in laboratories including flying particles, broken glass, molten metal, acids or caustic liquids, chemical liquids, chemical gases or vapors, or potentially injurious light radiation.\n\nAppropriate eye protection is required whenever working in or entering a laboratory in which hazardous chemical or infectious materials, or other mechanical or physical eye hazards are present. Eye and face protection must be selected on the basis of hazard and assessment of risk.\n\nAll laboratory employees and visitors are required to wear protective eyewear while in laboratories where chemicals are being handled or stored, at all times, even when not working directly with chemicals.\n\nOrdinaron glasses de adequatethe eyes.

Moreover, it is the vision of KAUST to be a leader among its peers in the international research community for its health, safety, and environmental performance.\n\nKAUST's commitment to health, safety, and environmental performance extends to all functions within the University. However, because of the special safety concerns that arise in a laboratory setting, this Laboratory Safety Manual has been developed by the Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) Department to serve as a general guide to laboratory safety within KAUST. It is to be used as a resource to assist laboratories in designing their own Laboratory Safety Plans.\n\nThis Laboratory Safety Manual is intended to establish basic safe operating practices so that faculty, staff, and students of KAUST may carry out effective educational and research programs in a safe and healthy environment. It is not intended to be a complete or final listing of all laboratory hazards or safe work practices. Because of the diverse nature of work being conducted at KAUST, additional procedures or requirements may be necessary for individual research labs.\n\nThe information contained within this laboratory safety manual is intended to comply with national regulations, international standards and laboratory best management practices.\n\nLABORATORY SAFETY PLAN\n\nEach laboratory where there is a risk of health or physical hazards is required to have a written Laboratory Safety Plan to protect against hazards to personnel, property, or the environment. This includes laboratories having hazardous materials (chemical, biological or radioactive), compressed gases, high-pressure, high-energy, Laser, X-Ray, or other significant physical, mechanical, or electrical hazards. The Laboratory Safety Plan should outline the lab-specific practices and procedures, personal protective equipment, training requirements, standard operating procedures, emergency procedures, and other safety requirements to protect employees from the hazards they may encounter in the laboratory. The Laboratory Safety Plan must be updated whenever there is a significant change in laboratory operations and/or hazards present, or a change in emergency contact personnel. A Laboratory Safety Plan template is available on the Lab Safety webpage.\n\n--- Page 7 ---",

Training requirements can be met in a variety of ways including videos, group training sessions, and handouts. Periodic retraining should be offered to both the employees and supervisors as appropriate. Examples of topics to be covered during the training include:\n\n- When PPE must be worn.\n- What PPE is necessary to carry out a procedure or experiment.\n- How to properly put on, take off, adjust, and wear PPE.\n- The proper cleaning, care, maintenance, useful life, limitations, and disposal of the PPE.\n\nIt is the responsibility of Principal Investigators and laboratory managers to ensure laboratory staff and students have received the appropriate training on the selection and use of proper PPE, that proper PPE is available and in good condition, and laboratory personnel use proper PPE when working in laboratories under their supervision.\n\nEYE PROTECTION\n\nEye protection is one of the most important and easiest forms of PPE to wear. Laboratory personnel must use eye protection for many of the chemical and physical hazards found in laboratories including flying particles, broken glass, molten metal, acids or caustic liquids, chemical liquids, chemical gases or vapors, or potentially injurious light radiation.\n\nAppropriate eye protection is required whenever working in or entering a laboratory in which hazardous chemical or infectious materials, or other mechanical or physical eye hazards are present. Eye and face protection must be selected on the basis of hazard and assessment of risk.\n\nAll laboratory employees and visitors are required to wear protective eyewear while in laboratories where chemicals are being handled or stored, at all times, even when not working directly with chemicals.\n\nOrdinaron glasses de adequatethe eyes.

Moreover, it is the vision of KAUST to be a leader among its peers in the international research community for its health, safety, and environmental performance.\n\nKAUST's commitment to health, safety, and environmental performance extends to all functions within the University. However, because of the special safety concerns that arise in a laboratory setting, this Laboratory Safety Manual has been developed by the Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) Department to serve as a general guide to laboratory safety within KAUST. It is to be used as a resource to assist laboratories in designing their own Laboratory Safety Plans.\n\nThis Laboratory Safety Manual is intended to establish basic safe operating practices so that faculty, staff, and students of KAUST may carry out effective educational and research programs in a safe and healthy environment. It is not intended to be a complete or final listing of all laboratory hazards or safe work practices. Because of the diverse nature of work being conducted at KAUST, additional procedures or requirements may be necessary for individual research labs.\n\nThe information contained within this laboratory safety manual is intended to comply with national regulations, international standards and laboratory best management practices.\n\nLABORATORY SAFETY PLAN\n\nEach laboratory where there is a risk of health or physical hazards is required to have a written Laboratory Safety Plan to protect against hazards to personnel, property, or the environment. This includes laboratories having hazardous materials (chemical, biological or radioactive), compressed gases, high-pressure, high-energy, Laser, X-Ray, or other significant physical, mechanical, or electrical hazards. The Laboratory Safety Plan should outline the lab-specific practices and procedures, personal protective equipment, training requirements, standard operating procedures, emergency procedures, and other safety requirements to protect employees from the hazards they may encounter in the laboratory. The Laboratory Safety Plan must be updated whenever there is a significant change in laboratory operations and/or hazards present, or a change in emergency contact personnel. A Laboratory Safety Plan template is available on the Lab Safety webpage.\n\n--- Page 7 ---",

Training requirements can be met in a variety of ways including videos, group training sessions, and handouts. Periodic retraining should be offered to both the employees and supervisors as appropriate. Examples of topics to be covered during the training include:\n\n- When PPE must be worn.\n- What PPE is necessary to carry out a procedure or experiment.\n- How to properly put on, take off, adjust, and wear PPE.\n- The proper cleaning, care, maintenance, useful life, limitations, and disposal of the PPE.\n\nIt is the responsibility of Principal Investigators and laboratory managers to ensure laboratory staff and students have received the appropriate training on the selection and use of proper PPE, that proper PPE is available and in good condition, and laboratory personnel use proper PPE when working in laboratories under their supervision.\n\nEYE PROTECTION\n\nEye protection is one of the most important and easiest forms of PPE to wear. Laboratory personnel must use eye protection for many of the chemical and physical hazards found in laboratories including flying particles, broken glass, molten metal, acids or caustic liquids, chemical liquids, chemical gases or vapors, or potentially injurious light radiation.\n\nAppropriate eye protection is required whenever working in or entering a laboratory in which hazardous chemical or infectious materials, or other mechanical or physical eye hazards are present. Eye and face protection must be selected on the basis of hazard and assessment of risk.\n\nAll laboratory employees and visitors are required to wear protective eyewear while in laboratories where chemicals are being handled or stored, at all times, even when not working directly with chemicals.\n\nOrdinaron glasses de adequatethe eyes.

However, because of the special safety concerns that arise in a laboratory setting, this Laboratory Safety Manual has been developed by the Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) Department to serve as a general guide to laboratory safety within KAUST. It is to be used as a resource to assist laboratories in designing their own Laboratory Safety Plans.\n\nThis Laboratory Safety Manual is intended to establish basic safe operating practices so that faculty, staff, and students of KAUST may carry out effective educational and research programs in a safe and healthy environment. It is not intended to be a complete or final listing of all laboratory hazards or safe work practices. Because of the diverse nature of work being conducted at KAUST, additional procedures or requirements may be necessary for individual research labs.\n\nThe information contained within this laboratory safety manual is intended to comply with national regulations, international standards and laboratory best management practices.\n\nLABORATORY SAFETY PLAN\n\nEach laboratory where there is a risk of health or physical hazards is required to have a written Laboratory Safety Plan to protect against hazards to personnel, property, or the environment. This includes laboratories having hazardous materials (chemical, biological or radioactive), compressed gases, high-pressure, high-energy, Laser, X-Ray, or other significant physical, mechanical, or electrical hazards. The Laboratory Safety Plan should outline the lab-specific practices and procedures, personal protective equipment, training requirements, standard operating procedures, emergency procedures, and other safety requirements to protect employees from the hazards they may encounter in the laboratory. The Laboratory Safety Plan must be updated whenever there is a significant change in laboratory operations and/or hazards present, or a change in emergency contact personnel. A Laboratory Safety Plan template is available on the Lab Safety webpage.\n\n--- Page 7 ---",
